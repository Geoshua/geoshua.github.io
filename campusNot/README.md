We do have one unresolved problem; you need to enable location permissions. Please do this to test our map, then disable the permission afterwards.
Optionally to ensure your security, you should close other clabsql pages, and check our uploaded code to see it is not malicious.

To enable / disable permissions for non-secure websites on chrome, you can visit:
chrome://flags/#unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure
and in the text-box write:
http://clabsql.clamv.jacobs-university.de
Then select enable/disable and relaunch the web browser. (there is a relaunch button on-screen).
